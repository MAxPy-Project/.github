### MAxPy Project 

âš¡ MAxPy - A Framework for Bridging Approximate Computing Circuits to its Applications

This is the project to the MAxPy framework in which the paper is under review.

MAxPy is an open-source framework for approximate computing. It is extremely flexible to explore the design space of any kind of circuits into Python-based applications. MAxPy is imported by the user as a Python package and automatically builds a cycle-accurate Python model of an approximate circuit design which can easily be emulated and integrated as a function in an application to simulate its behavior in the system.

ðŸ”­ We are working on the documentation.

**MAxPy-Project/MAxPy-Project** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
